My technical and architectural choices are based on my previous projects (school and internships projects), I implemented :
 -the Component folder that contains reusable code to inject in other components if needed.
 -the Pages folder that contains views ( a set of element : JSX / tags / reusable components..), we can access pages using routes.
-Services folder that contains all the services of the app (API/ security...). Considering that the challenge is small sized I didn't separate the service folder.

If allocated more time, I would solve the issue regarding the pagination part and implement it, add a filter and search functionnality.
